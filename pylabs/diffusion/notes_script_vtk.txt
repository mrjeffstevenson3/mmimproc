These are notes that describe the software script_vtk.txt

This script loops throught the various bbc subjects in order to process their vtk files
In order to call my fortran the script sets up three files 
1) f.vtk which is the main fiber bundle that Jeff gave me
2) base.vtk is the floor model that is used to define the lower floor
3) aal_motor.vtk is the ceiling model used in readfiber_binaryb.f

So once the script prepares these three files for each subject and for each type of fiber bundle,
then the software takes the files and quantifies the number of fibers that survive the inclusion which means that need 
to reach the floor and reach the ceiling.
